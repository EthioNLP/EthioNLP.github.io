Artificial intelligence (AI) is taking a shape and natural language processing (NLP) is the core component.  There are efforts throughout the world to conduct NLP for Ethiopian languages but without a formal communication among researchers. At COLING 2018, Santa Fe, USA, three researchers from Addis Ababa University ([Binyam](http://addisababa.academia.edu/BSeyoum)), University of Hamburg ([Seid](https://seyyaw.github.io/)), and University of Trento ([Surafel](https://ict.fbk.eu/people/detail/surafelml/)) took an initiative to create a formal NLP society for Ethiopian language NLP research.
